# Fast

Fast (temporary name) is a language project that I'm using to improve my skills in OCaml.

As of now I have only a few long term goals:

- Type Safety
- Mostly Purely functional
- Speed of execution

If this goes as planned, I will eventually product a compiled binary which is reasonably fast.

As of now, I have a simple ast-traversal interpreter. It's painfully slow compared to equivalent programs in other languages.
